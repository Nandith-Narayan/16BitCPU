# 16 Bit CPU
This is my attempt at designing, building, and programming a custom 16-bit CPU using discrete logic chips.

This repo contains:
- [ ] Logisim CPU simulation - [WIP]
- [ ] Assembler - [WIP]
- [ ] Schematic - [WIP]
- [ ] Pictures (Once built :D)

## Assembler
This assembler supports the following instructions with direct, indirect, and immediate addressing modes:

 - NOP
 - ADD
 - SUB
 - XOR
 - AND
 - OR
 - LD (A & B)
 - ST (A & B)
 - HLT
